# Epic AI® Legion

> ## ⭐ 1.3.0 — Signed Catalog Enforcement (Breaking Change)
>
> **Legion now cryptographically verifies the adapter catalog on every load and every refresh. Verification is ON BY DEFAULT.**
>
> **What this protects you from.** Before 1.3.0, the adapter catalog that tells Legion *which integrations exist and what tools they expose* was loaded without any signature check. A tampered `adapter-catalog.json` on disk — whether from a compromised dependency, a malicious patch, or a supply-chain attack against the npm package itself — would have been accepted and used. Tool-routing decisions would have been made against whatever the tampered catalog said. **As of 1.3.0, the catalog must carry a valid Ed25519 signature from a key Legion recognizes, or it refuses to load.** This closes one of the last remaining paths by which a compromised upstream artifact could silently redirect Legion's tool selection.
>
> **You get this for free if you're using the default bundled catalog.** The `@epicai/legion` npm package now ships `adapter-catalog.json.sig` alongside `adapter-catalog.json`. A bundled public key at `src/keys/legion-catalog-public.ts` verifies the shipped signature on every startup. You do not need to generate keys, run scripts, or change any configuration — just upgrade.
>
> **If you're running against a custom catalog or a custom registry**, you must sign your catalog (see `scripts/sign-catalog.mjs`) or explicitly opt out via `verifySignature: false` in `CatalogSourceConfig`. Opting out emits a loud startup warning on every boot — by design. You should not opt out for production workloads; it defeats the purpose of the change. If your custom catalog is internal and you're confident about the threat model, signing it takes two minutes with the script.
>
> **Migration in 30 seconds.** Upgrade to `@epicai/legion@1.3.0`. If your build breaks, read the error message — it will tell you exactly which of the three cases you hit (missing bundled `.sig`, missing registry `catalog-signature` header, or failed signature verification), and the fix for each. Full details in `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` → "Adapter Catalog Provenance" and in the 1.3.0 section of `CHANGELOG.md`.
>
> **This is best-of-breed practice.** Terraform Registry, Sigstore/Cosign, npm provenance attestations, Debian `apt`, Docker Content Trust, and Go modules all use signed catalogs or signed manifests as their default trust mechanism. Legion 1.3.0 brings Legion into line with that industry standard. Earlier versions of Legion documented the trust model but did not enforce it; 1.3.0 makes the documentation match the runtime.

*35,835 tools. One self-hosted MCP server. Your context window only loads what the query needs.*

**Context window cost: 469 tokens.** Legion exposes 3 tools to your AI client. The routing happens server-side — your context window never sees the full catalog.

Credentials stay on your machine. The routing stays on your machine. No tool executes a write operation without your explicit approval — read operations run automatically, write operations require confirmation, and you control the boundary per adapter and per operation type. Every action — approved, rejected, or automated — is logged with a timestamp, identity, and SHA-256 hash chain for tamper-evident audit. Legion is an Intelligent Virtual Assistant (IVA) that classifies intent, selects adapters, calls them, and synthesizes a response. Tool schemas and routing decisions never leave your machine — only the final query reaches your LLM, local or cloud. 35,835 tools across Salesforce, GitHub, AWS, Zillow, Epic FHIR, Spotify, Stripe, CrowdStrike, and 4,130+ more integrations — REST APIs, stdio MCPs, and streamable-HTTP MCPs (`legion list`). All three transports, one unified interface. A two-tier routing engine — BM25 + miniCOIL relevance scoring, then model-assisted classification — narrows the full catalog to the handful of tools each query actually needs. The first tier runs at zero inference cost; the model only sees a compact shortlist. One install, one config, and your agent reaches every tool. The default shortlist is 8 tools per query — configurable. You add your API or MCP keys and it works.

```bash
npx @epicai/legion
```

Cloud LLM users: no GPU required — your AI client handles classification. Local SLM users: see [DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md](DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md) for hardware specs by model size.

## How It Works

Legion operates in two modes depending on how you use AI:

### Cloud LLM Mode (most developers)

Your AI client (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, etc.) connects to Legion as a single MCP server. Three tool definitions (469 tokens) replace thousands. Legion's routing engine selects the right adapters, calls them, and returns results to your LLM for synthesis.

```

│  Credentials: ~/.epic-ai/.env (local only)   │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Local SLM Mode (air-gapped)

Legion runs the full orchestrator loop locally. A local SLM (llama.cpp, vLLM) handles tool selection. An optional cloud LLM handles synthesis. Or go fully air-gapped — nothing leaves your machine.

## Quick Start

```bash
npx @epicai/legion
```

The setup wizard:
1. **Detects your system** — Node.js, platform, local LLMs
2. **Scans for AI clients** — Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code, Codex, Gemini, and 5 more
3. **Auto-configures** — writes Legion to each client's MCP config (with your permission)
4. **Configures curated adapters** — zero-credential open data sources, ready immediately
5. **Proves routing** — runs demo queries to show each one routes to the correct adapter

30 seconds from `npx` to working IVA. Run `legion configure` after to connect your own APIs.

---

## Architecture

Two-tier tool resolution prevents context window bloat:

| Tier | Component | What it does | Cost |
|------|-----------|-------------|------|
| 1 | ToolPreFilter | BM25 + miniCOIL sparse scoring, top 8 from configured adapters | Zero inference |
| 2 | Orchestrator | LLM selects from the shortlist and makes tool calls | One inference call |

The full adapter catalog (35,835 tools) never reaches the LLM. Only the shortlisted 8 tools do.

---

## Adapters

4,135 integrations exposing 35,835 tools — 624 REST-only, 3,242 MCP-only, 246 dual (REST+MCP), 23 REST candidates. Transports: REST, stdio (3,004), streamable-HTTP (456), SSE (18), HTTP (1).

## Autonomy

Every tool call goes through a three-tier governance layer:

| Tier | Behavior | Example |
|------|----------|---------|
| `auto` | Executes immediately | Read, query, search, list |
| `escalate` | Executes, flags for review | Write, update, modify |
| `approve` | Blocks until human approves | Delete, revoke, terminate |

Unclassified actions default to `approve`. No tool writes to your systems without your explicit approval.

---

## Configuration

```typescript
import { EpicAI } from '@epicai/legion';

const agent = await EpicAI.create({
  orchestrator: {
    provider: 'auto',  // probes llama.cpp, vLLM
  },
  federation: {
    servers: [
      { name: 'github', transport: 'stdio', command: 'mcp-server-github' },
      { name: 'splunk', transport: 'streamable-http', url: 'https://splunk.corp/mcp' },
    ],
  },
  autonomy: {
    tiers: {
      auto: ['read', 'query', 'search', 'list'],
      escalate: ['write', 'update'],
      approve: ['delete', 'revoke', 'terminate'],
    },
  },
  persona: {
    name: 'assistant',
    tone: 'professional',
    domain: 'general',
    systemPrompt: 'You are a helpful assistant powered by Epic AI Legion.',
  },
  audit: {
    store: 'memory',
    integrity: 'sha256-chain',
  },
});

await agent.start();
const result = await agent.run('What are my open GitHub PRs?');
console.log(result.response);
await agent.stop();
```

See the [Developer Guide](DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md) for full configuration reference.

| Harness | `npm run test:harness` | 45 assertions across stdio, HTTP, and API transports |

See [docs/TEST-PROTOCOL.md](docs/TEST-PROTOCOL.md) for setup and the full [harness spec](docs/harness/).

---

## CLI Commands
