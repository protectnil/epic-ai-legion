## 0.5.0 — 2026-04-01

### Breaking Changes
- Package renamed from `@epicai/core` to `@epicai/legion`
- CLI commands renamed: `epic-ai` → `legion`, `epic-ai-gateway` → `legion-gateway`

### Added
- **29 new REST adapters** — 11 AWS services (DynamoDB, Lambda, IAM, CloudWatch, ECS, SNS, SQS, CloudTrail, Cost Explorer, Route 53, Redshift) + 18 industry verticals (FHIR, Opera PMS, Mews, Cloudbeds, InfoGenesis, Autodesk Construction, PlanGrid, Buildertrend, Epicor, Infor, Odoo, Majesco, Blackboard, PowerSchool, Bandwidth, Adobe Sign, Travelport, Trello). 870 REST adapters on disk.
- **Setup wizard** — interactive CLI with Clack prompts. Auto-detects 11 MCP clients (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code, Codex, Gemini, Cline, Continue, Goose, Roo Code, Claude Desktop). Writes MCP config with permission. Secrets provider integration (Vault, AWS SM, Azure KV, 1Password, Doppler).
- **MCP server mode** (`--serve`) — exposes `legion_query`, `legion_call`, `legion_list` tools. Hybrid routing (BM25 + miniCOIL + dense) to 42,946 tools across 3,887 integrations.
- **Subcommands** — `add`, `remove`, `health`, `list` with fuzzy matching
- **Elastic License 2.0** for adapters and registry (LICENSE-ADAPTERS)
- MCP registry cleaned to Node-only (Python/Go/Rust/Java entries archived)

### Changed
- Default adapter count: 870 REST + 3,017 MCP = 3,887 integrations, 42,946 tools

---

## 0.4.4 — 2026-03-24

### Added
- `mcp-registry.json` ships with package — 472 adapter connection configs (223 MCP + 472 REST).
- `RegistryLoader` — one-line adapter loading with credential resolution from env vars.
- Adapter sync service — autonomous MCP discovery, tool enumeration, Qdrant embeddings, GitHub publishing.
- MongoDB schema (`epicai_core.adapters`) — verbose source of truth with 37 indexes.
- 472 individual test files in `tests/adapters/`.
- `docs/KNOWN-ISSUES.md` — Llama 3.1 8B tool-calling limitation documented.
- Spec folder generators, CSV export, test file generators — all from MongoDB.

### Fixed
- All 472 adapters have `static catalog()` — adapter-catalog.json now contains 472 entries (was 470).

## 0.4.3 — 2026-03-24

### Fixed
- Default timeout increased to 30s for inference backends.
- Throughput test fix for concurrent request measurement.
- All 472 adapters now have `static catalog()` — adapter-catalog.json contains 472 entries.
- MCP registry (`mcp-registry.json`) ships with package — 472 entries, 223 vendor MCP configs, ready-to-connect.
- `RegistryLoader` — one-line adapter loading with automatic credential resolution from env vars.
- Adapter sync service — autonomous MongoDB-backed source of truth with MCP discovery, enumeration, and publishing.

## 0.4.2 — 2026-03-24

### Changed
- `provider: 'auto'` now probes `localhost:8080` (llama.cpp) as second priority, before Ollama fallback.
- Clear error message with setup instructions when no inference backend is available.

## 0.4.1 — 2026-03-24

### Fixed
- All adapters rewritten to ADAPTER-DEVELOPMENT-PROTOCOL — full tool coverage, MCP headers, static `catalog()` method on every adapter.
- Integration tests probe gateway first (`localhost:8000`), fall back to llama.cpp (`localhost:8080`), then Ollama — M5 Metal compatible.

## 0.4.0 — 2026-03-24

### Added
- **Inference Gateway** (`npx epic-ai-gateway`) — OpenAI-compatible HTTP router for llama.cpp, mlx-lm, and vLLM backends with circuit breakers, Redis-backed control plane, and leader-elected health checks.
- **Auto provider** — `provider: 'auto'` probes `localhost:8000` (gateway), `localhost:8080` (llama.cpp), `localhost:11434` (Ollama legacy). First responder wins.
- **Three-tier tool resolution** — DomainClassifier (keyword/semantic), BM25 ToolPreFilter, and SLM selection prevent context window bloat across 472 adapters.
- **Adapter sandboxing** — SandboxManager runs community and vendor adapters in process-isolated sandboxes with configurable memory limits, timeouts, and egress enforcement.
- **Adaptive connection pool** — Per-tenant burst-aware connection management with LRU/LFU eviction, replacing flat maxConnections.
- **Enterprise trust** — AuthMiddleware, AccessPolicyEngine, ArtifactVerifier (Sigstore/SLSA), and pluggable secrets providers.
- **PrometheusExporter** — new observability export format.
- **ADAPTER-DEVELOPMENT-PROTOCOL** — mandatory standard for all adapter contributions.

### Changed
- Default orchestrator provider changed from `'ollama'` to `'auto'`.
- Default model changed to `llama3.1:8b`.
- Ollama deprecated — Apple M5 Metal incompatibility ([#13867](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/issues/13867), [#13896](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/issues/13896), [#13460](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/issues/13460)) with no fix timeline. The Inference Gateway with llama.cpp is the reliable path across all Apple Silicon generations.
- Ollama `/api/chat` and `/api/generate` endpoints deprecated via OllamaShim (sunset 2026-12-31). Use OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` instead.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-03-24
