## 0.3.0 (unreleased)

### Added
- **Inference Gateway** (`npx epic-ai-gateway`) — OpenAI-compatible HTTP router for llama.cpp, mlx-lm, vLLM, and Ollama backends with circuit breakers, Redis-backed control plane, and leader-elected health checks.
- **Auto provider** — `provider: 'auto'` discovers local inference backends by probing standard ports (Ollama 11434, vLLM 8000, llama.cpp 8080, mlx-lm 5000).
- **Three-tier tool resolution** — DomainClassifier (keyword/semantic), BM25 ToolPreFilter, and SLM selection prevent context window bloat across 472 adapters.
- **Adapter sandboxing** — SandboxManager runs community and vendor adapters in process-isolated sandboxes with configurable memory limits, timeouts, and egress enforcement.
- **Adaptive connection pool** — Per-tenant burst-aware connection management with LRU/LFU eviction, replacing flat maxConnections.
- **Enterprise trust** — AuthMiddleware, AccessPolicyEngine, ArtifactVerifier (Sigstore/SLSA), and pluggable secrets providers.
- **PrometheusExporter** — new observability export format.
- **359 new adapters** — expanded from 113 to 472 across all enterprise domains.

### Changed
- Default orchestrator provider changed from `'ollama'` to `'auto'`.
- Default model changed to `mistral-small-3`.
- Ollama `/api/chat` and `/api/generate` endpoints deprecated via OllamaShim (sunset 2026-12-31). Use OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` instead.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-03-22

### Changed
- **Product renamed to Epic AI® IVA Core** — title, README, Developer Guide, package.json description, and footer all reflect IVA Core branding to align with U.S. Trademark Reg. No. 7,748,019
- **113 enterprise adapters** (was 40 cybersecurity-only) — expanded from 10 (ISC)² security domains to 7 operational categories: Security, DevOps & Infrastructure, Observability, Productivity & Collaboration, AI/ML Platforms, Business Operations, and Content & Social
- Adapter section reorganized by operational category with full vendor tables across all categories
- README "Why Epic AI®" section reordered — token efficiency, data sovereignty, and SLM latency now lead; governance and compliance follow
- README subtitle: "Local SLM orchestrates. Cloud LLM responds. Your data never leaves."
- Developer Guide intro broadened from "IVA framework for cybersecurity" to platform-level positioning across all adapter domains
- Developer Guide persona examples expanded from 2 (security-only) to 7: sentinel (security), ops-lead (DevOps), deal-desk (sales), controller (finance), chief (CEO), pm (product), people-ops (HR)
- Developer Guide orchestrator examples broadened to cross-functional queries
- Developer Guide memory examples now include security and sales use cases
- Developer Guide retrieval indexing example includes deployment runbook alongside threat/vuln data
- Data sovereignty section reframed from "security architecture" to "data sovereignty architecture" with cross-domain data examples
- Custom adapter examples renamed from `MySecurityTool` to `MyCustomAdapter`
- Persona name in all SDK examples changed from `praetor` to `sentinel`
- Approver email in autonomy examples changed from `ciso@corp.com` to `ops@corp.com`

### Added
- NOTICE file — Apache 2.0 Section 4(d) attribution carry-forward
- TRADEMARK.md added to npm package `files` array
- Managed adapter maintenance line in README and Developer Guide: "keeping adapters current as vendor APIs and MCP specifications evolve — available from protectNIL Inc."
- Trademark notice in README and Developer Guide expanded to cover all 7 operational domains

### Fixed
- Developer Guide Writing Custom Adapters section: `MyCustomAdapter` class now has constructor accepting `name` parameter, consistent with Federation Layer MCPAdapter example
- SECURITY.md: removed proprietary product name from public repo scope section

- StreamEvent discriminated union with typed interfaces exported from package root
- CHANGELOG.md
- Three runnable examples: basic-agent, cybersecurity-briefing, multi-persona
- Deterministic test harness with stdio, HTTP, and API profiles

### Fixed
- durationMs semantics aligned between Orchestrator.run() and JSONResponse.collect()

### Added
- IVA (Intelligent Virtual Assistant) positioning across all documentation
- 40 cybersecurity MCP adapters spanning all 10 (ISC)² security domains

### Fixed
